
1) Install dependencies > check dependencies.txt
2) Configure android files to ensure react-navigation works properly
3) do npm ls to verify that you have everything installed [should be similar enough]



Used to generate basic react app:
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init drawzAllProject

- Deleted typescript config file [not necessary but did it to ensure it doesnt conflict]

React Navigation && React Native:
npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install @react-navigation/drawer
npm install react-native-reanimated
npm install react-native-screens
npm install react-native-gesture-handler
npm install react-native-worklets

react native skia for drawing stuff:
npm install @shopify/react-native-skia

"
Android
Currently, you will need Android NDK to be installed. If you have Android Studio installed, make sure $ANDROID_NDK is available. ANDROID_NDK=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/<version> for instance.

If the NDK is not installed, you can install it via Android Studio by going to the menu File > Project Structure

And then the SDK Location section. It will show you the NDK path, or the option to download it if you don't have it installed.

Look at this to install ndk and cmake!!!! [THEY ARE NECESSARY!!]

 

Babel.config.js parser issue:
npm install react-native@latest metro-react-native-babel-preset@latest



Add this to your babel.config.js:
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@react-native/babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    'react-native-worklets/plugin', 
  ],
};



Make sure this is added in MainActivity.kt at drawzAllProject\android\app\src\main\java\com\drawzallproject\MainActivity.kt

import android.os.Bundle;

^^This import should be at the top of the file^^

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(null)
  }

^^Inside the class you find in MainActivity.kt, add this function! ^^^^

https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started
^^More context to why this is needed^^

IN THE CASE THAT STUFF AINT WORKING:
delete node_modules from the project directory
then do 
npm start -- --reset-cache
then
npm install



**********************************

OK if you believe you got everything downloaded, etc
DO THIS COMMAND

npm ls
